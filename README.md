# Secure Contain Protect_SCP
### This is a mini webscraping project to obtain information on SCP Foundation, including Series number, name and obeject class. And visualize obejct class in a countplot. 
 
 The SCP Foundation is a fictional organization documented by the web-based collaborative-fiction project of the same name. The SCP object is then assigned an "object class" (for example, "Euclid" or "Keter") based on the difficulty of containing it.  

🕷  Object Classes 🕷

🙂 Safe: easily and safely contained
🤔 Euclid: require more resources to contain completely or where containment isn't always reliable
😣 Keter: exceedingly difficult to contain consistently or reliably 
😵 Neutralized: no longer anomalous, either through having been intentionally or accidentally destroyed, or disabled.
🤐 Thaumiel: is used to contain other SCPs, and is classified at the highest levels of the Foundation
🙄 Esoteric: non-standard Object Classes. Do not fall into any of the above sections
